# Metrics

At this time, we have identified some metrics, and the following list could evolve :

- Time to make a consensus
- Difference of energy consumption between POI and POW
- Impact of latency (on the consensus duration, equality of chances winning the consensus ...)
- Chain forks frequency/probability
